## Limitations of the crowdfunding campaign data:
The following elements which may help to the survey:
1. The dataset should include the quality of the product which may or may not affect the number of backer count for the campaign.
2. The dataset should state the deadline for the delivery of the products.
## Other possible graphs and pivot tables:
Apart from the data represented through graphs made in this challenge, several other tables and graphs can be made through the same information.
1.	A graph showing outliers from the crowdfunding data set.
2.	A graph showing countries and their respective pledges. 
3.	The representation of data on the comparison on which country got successful and failed in the campaign.
4.	A graph representing goal of crowdfunding campaigns with respective to the number of backer count.

## Statistical Analysis:
Upon doing a statistical analysis of the data set, it was determined that the data is skewed and not symmetrical. Hence, median is the most suitable way to summarize this data.
